## Library Management Software 

To run the whole codebase, clone the repository and execute the following command. 

`cd Assignment-1`

`make main`

`./main`

In the CLI, try to follow the instructions strictly like where a number is supposed to be entered, enter a number there and not an alphabet. 

In the implemented application, at the start you will need to create a master librarian,say - 

    {
        name: master,
        ID: master,
        password: master
    }

After doing this, you will be asked to login into the application where for the first time you will only be able to login using the master librarian credentials. 
From here start adding new users/books. 

And then keep switching between users to see other functionalities as well.
